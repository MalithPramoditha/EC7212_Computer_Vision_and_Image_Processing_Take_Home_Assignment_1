# Image Processing Assignment – EC7212 Computer Vision and Image Processing

This repository contains solutions to four essential image processing tasks using Python, OpenCV, and Google Colab. The tasks include:

1. **Intensity Quantization:**  
   Reducing the number of intensity levels in a grayscale image.

2. **Spatial Averaging (Smoothing):**  
   Applying mean filters with different kernel sizes to smooth images.

3. **Image Rotation:**  
   Rotating images by specified angles (e.g., 45° and 90°).

4. **Blockwise Averaging (Spatial Resolution Reduction):**  
   Simulating lower spatial resolution by averaging non-overlapping blocks.

## Example Image

The classic "Lena" image is used for demonstration, as it is widely recognized in the image processing community.

## How to Run

You can run the code directly in a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/):

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-assignment.git
    ```
2. **Open the notebook in Colab or Jupyter.**
3. **Install dependencies if needed:**
    ```
    !pip install opencv-python matplotlib
    ```
4. **Run the cells to see results and visualizations.**
